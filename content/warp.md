### BACKGROUND

In this project we were working with Warp,
a startup redefining the terminal experience by leveraging AI and collaborative tools.

<br>

The guiding prompt and question that we wanted to explore in this project was: Warp has a robust theming system, but creating custom themes is cumbersome. Can we leverage AI to generate fun themes for users to enjoy and share?

<br>

### My role

Having a unique background with using a terminal for software development, I led the team through design aspects that considered unique terminal features. 

<br>

### Discovery & research

<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
How is Warp's interface unique?
</div>

<div>

- Terminals that Warp works with are intended for desktops.
- Our project specifically will be considering how to re-design and develop theme customization within the settings for the Warp application
- Almost like customizing features that exist in Apple laptop settings or Google gmail

</div>
</div>







<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Who are we designing for?
</div>

<div>

- Definition is critical to our project
- We are designing for a select group of software developers and IT professionals that use terminals in their day to day
- The user base are technically equipped, look for tools that integrate with their workflow, and require functionality in their development environment

</div>
</div>






<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
What is our intended impact?
</div>

<div>

- Achieving productivity by leveraging Warp’s AI theme generation features, while providing direct field customization to reach maximum user tailoring experience
- Being able to select themes that were generated by their fellow developer community directly in the interface
- By being able to share themes and upload them directly, this will eliminate friction for users in using other communication channels to share themes

</div>
</div>


### Sketches

Our first step in this design process was to brainstorm at least four possible very high level designs for the problem statement. The goal was to reflect a wide range of layouts possible to get ideas flowing and for us to communicate with each other on how we view the problem.

<br>

We did not look at the existing interface when sketching, but rather wanted to see how we can imagine the product looking like, to get the largest variety of ideas out there.

<br>

After individually finishing our sketches on what the solution to our client’s design problem was, we discussed as a team the following points:

- What parts of the sketches really address the overarching design prompt?
- What parts of the sketches are starting to incorporate the key project success metrics?
- Though we all sketched alternative solutions to the start-up’s goals, what recurring solutions did we see across all of our sketches?

### takeways

We compared our sketches and ideas with Warp’s existing Settings interface, we decided which features of our sketches integrated best with their existing designs. 

<br>

<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Design elements to include:
</div>

<div>

- Sharing themes across different social media platforms based on fulfillment of one of the project’s success metrics
- Users should be able to edit their existing themes as this addresses an existing gap in Warp’s existing interface
- “Card” preview of the theme as certain fields are being edited since users should be able to see layouts of edits immediately
- Carousel of themes available within settings as we want to increase theme sharing (project metric)
- The key design principle that we wanted to retain from all sketches as, users should have the ability to share their AI generated themes directly in the terminal as well as provide additional options in Settings
- Built off the sketch that provided a gallery of existing themes and combined this with the sketch that shows how users could search for keywords into one – where users can search for existing themes using keywords

</div>
</div>




<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Design elements to leave out:
</div>

<div>

- Focusing less on the terminal to settings flow – Warp has already integrated this design feature
- Theme gallery should not be a continuous vertical scroll within the actual settings, since there are other sections in settings that theme customization would fit within
- Considering when to use horizontal versus vertical scrolls after reviewing Warp’s existing interface and their designated uses of either scroll type</li>

### FEEDBACK

After the creation of our initial low fidelity design, we were able to receive critique on our wireframe from both Warp's design team and critical stakeholders:

<br>

<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Elements to enhance:
</div>

<div>

- Focusing less on the terminal to settings flow – Warp has already integrated this design feature
- Theme gallery should not be a continuous vertical scroll within the actual settings, since there are other sections in settings that theme customization would fit within
- Considering when to use horizontal versus vertical scrolls after reviewing Warp’s existing interface and their designated uses of either scroll type

</div>
</div>




<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Elements to rethink:
</div>

<div>

- Try to keep the main features in the primary flow, avoid pop-ups for most critical components
- Think about not making users work too hard for simple tasks, what can be automated?
- Too much choice for themes can lead to user choice paralysis – provide a smaller set of options within settings, and embed further personalization in pop-up windows

</div>
</div>




<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Key takeaways to communicate with Warp:
</div>

<div>

- Not all the research and decisions reached are incorporated into the final design presented to Warp
- Clearly communicate the intentions behind our design, and how we purposefully decided to exclude certain elements
- It’s okay to go back into the success metrics and brief, and ask ourselves, “Is this too complex? Is this component necessary to the user experience”?

</div>
</div>

### Iterating forward


Our team sat down to discuss the feedback from critical stakeholders and started iterating changes by drawing out new designs.

We iterated through a stack of scrap paper to challenge ourselves to intuitively brainstorm solutions to the feedback receieved.

              add more and more generated themes?
              Can users delete or update themes in their repo? Can users share themes directly from their repo with
              the click of a share button?

          </figure>
        </div>
      </div>

### MINIMIZING FRICTION

Then we went back into <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/sfbxku4/pdczexw/r9EF3">our Balsamiq File</a> and created an improved version to our low fidelity design, really emphasizing minimizing friction to users, and what users owuld want on the main page versus features more appropriate for pop-ups. We also went in and annotated (with the yellow sticky notes), how we could further address the stakeholder's feedback when moving from Lo-Fi to Hi-Fi mocking up in Figma.

<br>

<img style="border: 1px solid grey; border-radius: 5px" id="reworked-lo-fi-wireframe" alt="sticky note annotations on a low fidelity mockup" src="./images/warp/wireframes-post-crit/Lo-Fi_Annotations.png">

<br>

### preparing for Hi-fi

Here were some of our key concerns that we annotated on Balsamiq that we noted when starting to brainstorm for our Hi-Fi prototype:

<br>

<img style="border: 1px solid grey; border-radius: 5px" id="reworked-lo-fi-annotations" alt="close up of sticky note comments" src="./images/warp/wireframes-post-crit/Lo-Fi_Crit_Takeaways.png" />

<br>

<br>

One of the stakeholders suggested getting rid of extra modals to minimize user friction. However our team decided to continue to include pop-up windows where appropriate, because we wanted users to experience layers of customization. 

<br>

We wanted to further refine our vision on that to show the stakeholders how we believed in this part of our design.  

### High fidelity

Following the visual design guide and brand manual provided to us by Warp, we were able to integrate our visions for the design with the existing interface of Warp's settings. 
<br>
This took a few tries to nail down their design system with what we were envisioning, but eventually we got to our first high fidelity design.

### Feedback


<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Elements to enhance:</div>

<div>

- Ability to upload yaml files (theme file type) directly into the theme customization workflow
- WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) theme editor works well with the preview changing, make it even clearer that this is a card/preview of the terminal
- Theme Repo works well, also in developer lingo. Make clearer how the “add new theme” button stays in the user’s preview as their repo grows, consider a global placement always as the first in the list, even if the number of themes grows.

</div>
</div>





<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Elements to rethink:</div>

<div>

- Ways to combine manual customization window with AI theme customization, as users continue to change individual fields of the theme
- Warp’s team thinks further improvements could be made to their currently “selected theme”, what are some other ways we can display the selected theme to users in the main part of settings?
- Consider different preview card sizes through segmenting controls. Unclear user story for when both the UI controls and code are needed simultaneously.

<br>

### refelections & Future improvements

<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Final Design changes made:</div>

<div>

- Explicitly designing the preview of the terminal in manual customization as a card feature
- Communicating that an image can be uploaded and then used to further prompt Warp’s AI features
- Giving a global placement to the “create new theme” button so this does not get lost in the Repo as users generate more themes

</div>
</div>



<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Top insights gathered:</div>

<div>

- Most developers only change their main theme every few months, so most specific customization fields can be placed further in settings as pop-up windows
- Addressing the increase in theme sharing can be quantified in many different ways according to different user stories
    - Through social media used by the dev community: Discord, GitHub, and Slack (professionally)
    - By tracking how many users use the copy or download button in the code preview of the manual customization page
- Though generating images through a newer text-to-image model is compelling, most developers use images of personal value to them or through more advanced models like MidJourney.

</div>
</div>



<div class="highlight-grid">
<div class="font-lg">
Next steps and enhancements:</div>

- Many developers leverage Warp’s capabilities to work in multiple development environments. 
    - For example, a user may have a highly sensitive or proprietary environment in which they want their terminal to appear red to signal that this is the open terminal among many that may be open. 
    - How could we design a system in which developers can select multiple themes for different dev environments? 
- Enhancing the "selected theme" card in the initial landing page of settings.
    - How can we nudge users to customize their themes with the AI-powered features?
