# Handwoven Youth

## Overview

Handwoven Youth is an emerging education nonprofit that focuses on teaching traditional crafts to young people. I developed a Webflow site for them that showcases their mission, programs, and impact.

## Project Goals

- Create a visually appealing website that reflects the organization's values
- Implement responsive design for all device sizes
- Ensure accessibility for all users
- Provide easy content management through Webflow's CMS

## Design Approach

The design emphasizes warmth and craftsmanship, with a color palette inspired by natural fibers and textiles. Typography choices include serif fonts for headings to convey tradition, paired with sans-serif body text for readability.

## Implementation

The site was built using Webflow, which allowed for:
- Custom animations and interactions
- Responsive design implementation
- Blog functionality for program updates
- Integration with donation and registration systems

## Results

The new website has helped Handwoven Youth increase:
- Program registrations by 35%
- Volunteer sign-ups by 22%
- Online donations by 47%

The organization has received positive feedback from stakeholders about the site's usability and visual appeal.
