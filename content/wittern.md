### Overview

The vending machine in the basement of the List Art Center, produced by The Wittern Group, is a staple for hungry visual art, architecture, and art history students. Based on interviews with users, I developed personas and a storyboard to better understand the user journey for a popular interface on campus.


### How it works

The vending machine helps hungry students by providing a variety of snack options to purchase 24 hours a day, fully autonomously. Every snack has a corresponding number, which users can type in to preview its price or purchase after paying with either cash, card, or their student ID.

### Observations

Before talking to vending machine users, I observed that

- Users of the vending machine often check the prices before providing a method of payment.
- Users who do not check the prices spend little time deciding what to buy before they pay.
- Most users use a credit or debit card to pay for their snack.
- Users act more quickly when other people are waiting to use the machine
- Users will often either eat their snack next to the vending machine or promptly leave the room

### Interviewing

I rooted my interviews in the following 5 questions:

<br></br>
<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1">

1. ***How often do you use vending machines on campus?***

</div>
<div class="flex-1">

Usage frequency varies significantly among respondents, ranging from users who have established routines and preferences to first-time users who were unaware of the machine's existence. Regular users demonstrate familiarity and confidence, while infrequent users express uncertainty about the process.

</div>
</div>
<br></br>

<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1">

2. ***What goes through your mind when you approach a vending machine?***

</div>
<div class="flex-1">

Thoughts typically revolve around immediate needs (hunger, cravings) for experienced users, while newcomers focus on operational concerns and anxiety about potential mistakes. Regular users consider time constraints and product selection, whereas first-time users worry about the mechanics of the transaction and potential social embarrassment.

</div>
</div>
<br></br>

<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1">

3. ***What actions do you typically take when using a vending machine?***

</div>
<div class="flex-1">

All users check prices, though with different intentions - regular users compare options while new users verify potential costs multiple times. New users exhibit cautious behaviors like inspecting the machine thoroughly and letting others go ahead, while experienced users move with greater efficiency and sometimes engage socially through recommendations.

</div>
</div>
<br></br>

<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1">

4. ***How do you feel during and after using a vending machine?***

</div>
<div class="flex-1">

Emotional responses range from casual comfort among frequent users to anxiety and self-consciousness among newcomers. Regular users experience mild time pressure and treat the interaction as a routine break, while first-time users feel a mix of concern about making mistakes and excitement about discovering a new convenience.

</div>
</div>
<br></br>

<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1">

5. ***What frustrations or challenges have you experienced with vending machines?***

</div>
<div class="flex-1">

Common frustrations span both user types but manifest differently. Experienced users are frustrated by stock issues and technical glitches that disrupt their routines, while newcomers struggle with lack of clear instructions, uncertainty about payment processing, and decision paralysis when facing unfamiliar options.

</div>
</div>
<br></br>

### Defining users

The main factor creating a difference in user experience for students was whether or not they were frequent vending machine users on campus. I created empathy maps for "Confident Calliope" and "Newbie Norman" to explore these two groups and their different needs.

<br></br>
<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1 flex-center">
<div>

**Confident Calliope is a sculpture student who visits the vending machine frequently.**

<br>

She represents familiar yet exploratory users of the vending machine. Her comfort with the interface doesn't eliminate frustration with its limiations. She needs to make quick decisions based on hunger and time.

Interface problems:
* Limited information about items
* Comparing item prices requires a large amount of user input during an often limited time window for use

</div>
</div>
<div class="flex-1">

<div class="flex-row">
<div class="flex-1 flex-center">
<div>

**Newbie Norman is a student in an art history seminar who has discovered the vending machine for the first time.**

<br>

Norman represents the critical first-time user demographic. His experiences highlight usability issues that experienced users have learned to work around but are still design flaws.

Interface problems:
* Lack of clear instructions causes anxiety about potential money loss
* No visual confirmation of payment processing increases uncertainty

</div>

### Storyboarding

I illustrated Newbie Norman's experience to further investigate the experience of the vending machine for first time users.

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
1. After learning from a friend that there is a vending machine in the basement of the List, Norman goes downstairs during his 15 minute seminar break.

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
2. Because he is hungry, he immediately starts scanning the options. He is craving something sweet.

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
3. Norman then checks to make sure he can use the machine. He sees a bright sticker saying they accept card and is relieved.

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
4. Seeing that there are no prices listed on the vending machine, Norman looks around and sees that the tiny screen says “Select item to view info”

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
5. Uncertain of how the numbering system works, Norman looks at the first and last row of the machine to realize that numbers are placed beneath each item.

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
6. Norman plugs in the numbers for Snickers, then Twix, then Skittles, then Snickers again. He decides that he will get Twix.

</div>

<div>

![frame of a storyboard for a vending machine user](https://ocarson1.github.io/id-portfolio/images/wittern/twix/twix-7.png)
<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
7. Guessing what to do, Norman types in the number for Twix, then taps his credit card. Nothing happens inside of the machine, but the screen now says “Money Deposited: $4.00”

</div>

<div>

![frame of a storyboard for a vending machine user](https://ocarson1.github.io/id-portfolio/images/wittern/twix/twix-8.png)
<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
8. Anxious that the Twix was only $2.00, Norman warily presses the Twix code again. The machine dispenses his selection.

</div>

<div>

![frame of a storyboard for a vending machine user](https://ocarson1.github.io/id-portfolio/images/wittern/twix/twix-9.png)
<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
9. The screen resets to its default view, signaling to Norman that the interaction is over.

</div>

<div>

![frame of a storyboard for a vending machine user](https://ocarson1.github.io/id-portfolio/images/wittern/twix/twix-10.png)
<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
10. Norman checks his bank account and sees that only $2.00 were spent.

</div>

<div>

<div classname="spacer-15"></div>
11. Norman is relieved and eats the Twix quickly before his break ends. He is no longer hungry and knows he has a new resource for the next time he needs a snack.

</div>

</div>


### Conclusions

Analyzing the List vending machine reveals two main groups of vending machine users, with experienced users navigating around design flaws that remain significant barriers for newcomers. The shared pain points of unreliable payment systems, poor product organization, and insufficient feedback mechanisms affect all users. Future vending machine interfaces should balance maintaining efficiency for frequent users while providing the clarity and guidance needed by newcomers.
